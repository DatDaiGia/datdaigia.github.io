Hi, welcome to my page :milky_way:!

I am currently a Ph.D. student working on Deepfake Detection under the supervision of <a href="https://cvi2.uni.lu/profile-djamila-aouada/">Prof. Djamila AOUADA.</a>. My research interests includes Deepfake Detection, Autonomous Driving, and Recommendation Systems.

Besides, I am also a petite Dad of my baby :orange:, a Freethinker :cloud:, a Sing-lover, and a Health enthusiast :running:.
