title: Deepfake Detection
description: In the project, I focus on developing advanced methods to detect high-quality and unseen deepfakes that the developing models even have not seen them during the training period. Our approaches not only show superior performance on several datasets as compared to state-of-the-art methods, but also demonstrate more robustness to unseen common pertubations, e.g., Gaussian Noise, etc. Interestingly, our models are friendly computal overhead, highlighting their practical usefulness. We have published 3 papers with 2 of them accepted to top-tier conferences in Computer Vision.
